# About Cerns Open Data Portal

![](.gitbook/assets/cern.gif)

The CERN [Open Data portal](http://opendata.cern.ch/) is the access point to a growing range of data produced through the research performed at [CERN](https://home.cern/). It disseminates the preserved output from various research activities, including accompanying software and documentation which is needed to understand and analyse the data being shared.

The portal adheres to established global standards in data preservation and Open Science: the products are shared under open licenses; they are issued with a digital object identifier \(DOI\) to make them citable objects in the scientific discourse \(see details below on how to do this\). 

As scientists we believe in sharing and giving others access to our findings. As [CERN](https://home.cern/) continues to develop there is more data released to the [Open Data Portal](http://opendata.cern.ch/). In fact there is more than one petabyte of data right at our fingertips, so why not use it! We are trying to develop a more efficient and explicit way of accessing this data with hope that others can use it and lead us to new discoveries!
