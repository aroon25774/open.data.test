# Downloading Data Files from your Virtual Machine

### There maybe several ways of getting data off of the virtual machine. However using google drive maybe the easiest. Below are steps on how to do this: 

1. Open your VM web browser
2. Go to your google drive
3. Click new
4. Then select file upload 
5. Click on your desired file
6. Then your file should upload allowing you to access the data off of the virtual machine

This is beneficial to us because while the CernVM has great data analysis tools. We can do even more with the data once we get it off of the virtual machine. For example coding for specific decays using Google Colab or Jupyter Notebooks
