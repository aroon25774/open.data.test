# Data Analytics off and on the Virtual Machine

### There maybe several ways of getting data off of the virtual machine. However using google drive maybe the easiest. Below are steps on how to do this: 

1. Open your VM web browser
2. Go to your google drive
3. Click new
4. Then select file upload 
5. Click on your desired file
6. Then your file should upload allowing you to access the data off of the virtual machine

This is beneficial to us because while the CernVM has great data analysis tools. We can do even more with the data once we get it off of the virtual machine. For example coding for specific decays using Google Colab or Jupyter Notebooks

### Running data off of the virtual machine

Some of the following is Git commands. If you are unfamiliar with how git works then we recommend taking a short and free interactive course to learn it fast. Here is a link to the course:

1. One way we can analyze the data is using a Git repository. This was we can create a python script that can then be used to analyze the data. You can create a python script from your terminal at anytime however using Git allows you to share your code which in this case share your python script which allows others to build on it.
