# Accessing and Creating a Virtual Machine

###                                                Running CernVM

CernVM stands for Cern Virtual Machine. This will run on your VirtualBox installed previously. There are different versions of CernVM that we can stream. For example accessing data from 2010 requires a different download than accessing data from 2012. For purposes of just getting started it is recommended that we start with data from 2010 as it is much easier to work with. However below are links to access data data from all years. 

### Step 1: 

* [ ] For access to the 2010 data download the set of files found at the bottom of the link: [http://opendata.cern.ch/record/250](http://opendata.cern.ch/record/250) 
* [ ] For access to the 2011-2012 data download the set of files found at the bottom of the link: [http://opendata.cern.ch/record/252](http://opendata.cern.ch/record/252)

It is recommended using CMS-OpenData-1.1.2.ova for the 2010

### Step 2: 

* [ ] Once downloaded, start VirtualBox and import the files you just downloaded
